# Progress Log

Reverse-chronological build log for Hestia. Each entry is one working session.

## Stage 1 (v0.1) — Local model runtime + CLI chat — ✅ Complete

**Goal:** run a local model, talk to it from a terminal — no memory, tools, or personality yet.

**Hardware:** RTX 5060 (8GB VRAM), 16GB system RAM, Windows.

### 2026-09-05 — Ollama installed, model pulled, GPU inference verified

**Installed Ollama for Windows**
- Native app, no admin rights required, installs to the user profile.
- Installer auto-adds `ollama` to PATH and starts it as a background service.
- Verified: `ollama --version` returns a version string; `http://localhost:11434` returns `Ollama is running`.
- Confirmed NVIDIA driver meets Ollama's minimum (452.39+) via `nvidia-smi`.

**Pulled a model**
- `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` — default library tag, already quantized (Q4-class, ~4-5GB on disk).
- Verified with `ollama list`.

**Ran it and confirmed GPU inference**
- `ollama run qwen2.5:7b` — interactive chat in the terminal, streaming responses.
- Generation speed well above reading pace — the expected signal of GPU (not CPU) inference.
- `nvidia-smi`'s per-process memory column showed `N/A` for `llama-server.exe` (Ollama's actual inference subprocess). This is expected, not an error — Windows' WDDM driver model doesn't expose per-process VRAM to `nvidia-smi`; only the top-level total is reliable there.
- Confirmed GPU usage a different way instead: the process was tagged `Type: C` (pure compute), distinct from every other `C+G` (compute+graphics) process in the list — combined with the speed observation, that's sufficient confirmation without needing the missing memory figure.

**Status:** steps 1–3 of 6 complete for this stage. Next: Python environment setup (step 4).

### 2026-09-05 — Python environment, repo tooling, and the chat script

**Set up the Python environment**
- Created a `venv` inside the project folder, activated it, upgraded `pip`.
- `pip install ollama` — the official Python client for Ollama's API.

**Connected the local folder to GitHub**
- `git init`, added `.gitignore` (excludes `venv/`, and forward-looking entries for `.env` and database files ahead of Stage 3/6), linked `origin`, and pulled down the README/PROGRESS already on GitHub with `--allow-unrelated-histories`.
- Linked the same folder in VS Code's Source Control panel and GitHub Desktop — all three (terminal, VS Code, GitHub Desktop) now read/write the same local `.git` folder interchangeably.

**Wrote `chat.py`**
- Minimal CLI loop: reads input, sends the running in-memory conversation history to `ollama.chat(..., stream=True)`, prints the streamed response, appends it to history.
- No persistence — history lives only for the life of the running process (that's Stage 3's job).
- Handles a missing/unreachable Ollama service with a clear message instead of a raw stack trace.

**Ran it end to end**
- Multi-turn exchange confirmed the model correctly used earlier context (in-memory history working as intended).
- Streaming output confirmed working, matching the `ollama run` behavior from step three.
- Clean exit via typed `exit` and `Ctrl+C`, both tested.

**Stage 1 (v0.1) milestone met:** a CLI loop where typing a message gets a coherent response from a model running entirely on this machine, with no internet call involved.
